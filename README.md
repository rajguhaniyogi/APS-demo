# APS-demo
This folder contains codes to implement the four methods described in the course.

(A) R code to implement Bayesian tensor regression.

(B) R code to implement Bayesian symmetric tensor response regression.

(C) Distributed implementation for space-time models.

We will point out to another GitHub repository for implementing

(D) Bayesian tensor response regression

Each method is implemented as a function.
Please follow the instructions in the authors guide to implement these codes.
The authors guide details out the arguments and outputs for each function.
