# APS-demo
This folder contains codes to implement the four methods described in the course.
(A) R code to implement Bayesian tensor regression.
(B) R code to implement Bayesian tensor response regression.
(C) R code to implement Bayesian symmetric tensor response regression.
(D) Distributed implementation for space-time models.
Each method is implemented as a function.
Please follow the instructions in the authors guide to implement these codes.
The authors guide details out the arguments and outputs for each function.
